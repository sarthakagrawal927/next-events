# Events

Works pretty fast locally. Serverless functions take a toll right now I think.

To fix:
Getting 404 error in post and get request of comments. Newsletter works fine.

Python test was a success.

By using

```bash
vercel dev
```

I can easily see things in action for production env. But still I can't seem to fix the error.
